Browsing activity simulator
Currently configured to work with Reddit, but can be easily modified to work with any website. 
To use, create a new bookmark, and copy the code into the 'Location' field. Visit any frontpage on Reddit and run the bookmarklet. The script will insert a textfield at the top of the document that controls the delay between clicks. If you enter 5 in it, for instance, it will click links anywhere between every 5 and 55 seconds.
